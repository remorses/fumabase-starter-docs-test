# User-Focused Documentation

The best documentation doesn't just explain features—it helps users accomplish their goals. Focus on outcomes, not just functionality.

## Understanding User Intent

Before documenting any feature, understand the jobs users are trying to do. Documentation should bridge the gap between what users want to achieve and how your product helps them get there.
